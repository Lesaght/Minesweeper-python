# Minesweeper with Registration and Login

This repository contains a web-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, enhanced with user registration and login functionality.  Players can create accounts, track their high scores, and compete against others (future feature).

## Features

• **User Registration and Login:** Secure user accounts allow players to save their progress and high scores.  Password hashing is implemented for security.
• **High Score Tracking:**  The game keeps track of high scores for each difficulty level for each user.
• **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to be playable on various screen sizes, including desktops and mobile devices. (Further optimization may be needed)
